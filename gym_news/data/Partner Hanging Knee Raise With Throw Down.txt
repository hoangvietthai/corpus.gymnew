Partner Hanging Knee Raise With Throw Down
  Hang from a pull-up bar with your arms extended and your feet together (use ab straps if your grip is weak). Lock a slight bend in your knees. This will be your starting position.
 Without swinging your body, contract your lower abs to raise your knees just past a position in which your thighs are parallel to the floor.
 As your pelvis begins to curl upward, your partner should forcefully press down just above your knees to push your legs back to the starting position.
 Engage your abs and try to resist the movement. With their free hand your partner can push against your lower back to ensure your body doesnâ€™t swing.
