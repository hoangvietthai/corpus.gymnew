Rotating Back Fly
Sit on the top edge of the glideboard and hold the handles with your hands, arms extended out in front of you.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling on one handle towards its side of your body and allow yourself back down after a short pause. Alternate sides between repetitions.
Keep your arms fully extended throughout (or keep the small bend in your elbows constant).
