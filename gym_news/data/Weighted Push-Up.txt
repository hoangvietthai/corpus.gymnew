Weighted Push-Up
  Start by holding a plate with both hands at chest level. Lower yourself down into a kneeling position, and bring the plate behind your head. Take one hand off of the plate and bring it down to the floor to help support your body while you place the weight on your back. Extend your legs back so that you are in a full plank position.  Once the plate feels secure on your back, bring your other arm down and place your hands about 36 inches apart.  This part can be simplified by having a partner place the weight on your back. This will be your starting position. 
 Lower yourself down until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Next, breathe out and press your upper body back into the starting position. 
 Repeat this pattern for the desired number of repetitions.
