Burpee
 Begin standing with your legs shoulder-width apart.
 Place your hands on the floor and kick your legs back so you end up with your stomach and thighs on the floor. Your elbows should be bent.
 From this position, press up like you're doing a push-up and push your hips up.
 Jump your feet under your hips and stand.
 Finish the movement by jumping in the air and bringing your hands over your head.
 Repeat.
