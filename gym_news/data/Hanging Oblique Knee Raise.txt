Hanging Oblique Knee Raise
 Take a grip on pull-ups bars; hang with your knees together and your body straight. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by flexing the hips and knees, drawing the legs up. Pull the knees up into one side, going above 90 degrees at the hip. Avoid any swinging, performing the exercise with control.
 Return to the starting position and then perform the movement to the other side. Continue alternating until the set in complete.
