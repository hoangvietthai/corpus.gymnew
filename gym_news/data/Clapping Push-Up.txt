Clapping Push-Up
 Begin in the up position of a push-up: arms extended, back and neck in a straight line, and core tight. This will be your starting position. 
 Descend into the bottom position of the push-up by flexing at the elbows until they reach a 90-degree position. 
 Push upwards as powerfully as possible through your hands to propel yourself upwards off the ground and into the air. 
 Bring your hands together to complete a clap while in the air. Return to the starting position and immediately transition into a subsequent repetition.
 Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
