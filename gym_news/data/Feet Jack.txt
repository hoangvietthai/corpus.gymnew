Feet Jack
Start with your feet together, arms bent, and elbows at your side.
At the same time, jump both feet out to the side, allowing your elbows to swing out slightly. 
Immediately reverse the motion by jumping back to the starting position and bringing your elbows back into your side. 
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
