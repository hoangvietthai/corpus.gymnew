One-Arm Open Palm Kettlebell Clean
Place one kettlebell between your feet.
 Grab the handle with one hand and raise the kettlebell rapidly, let it flip so that the ball of the kettlebell lands in the palm ofyour hand.
 Throw the kettlebell out in front of you and catch the handle with one hand.
 Take the kettlebell to the floor and repeat.  Make sure to work both arms.
