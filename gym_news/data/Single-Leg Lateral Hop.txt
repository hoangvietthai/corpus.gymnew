Single-Leg Lateral Hop
Stand to the side of a cone or hurdle. To get into the start position, stand on one leg with your knee slightly bent.
 To begin, execute a counterjump to hop sideways over the cone.
 Land on your jumping leg, and immediately rebound out of it by jumping back to the start position.
 Continue hopping back and forth.
