Prone Triceps Extension
Lie prone on the glideboard and hold the handles with your hands below your shoulders, elbows bent and palms facing down.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles back towards the sides of your buttocks, straightening your arms and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your upper arms in the same position throughout.
