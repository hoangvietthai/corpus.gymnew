Sit-Up with Cable
Sit down on the glideboard looking up, knees bent and hold the handles with your hands, arms extended.
Roll your upper body up until your lower back no longer touches the glideboard and lower yourself back down after a short pause.
To avoid pulling your neck with your hands, look straight up instead of looking at your knees.
