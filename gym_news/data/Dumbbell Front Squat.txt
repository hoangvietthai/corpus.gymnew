Dumbbell Front Squat
 Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, holding a pair of light dumbbells down by your sides. Clean the dumbbells up to your shoulders so that one end of each dumbbell rests on top of each shoulder. Balance the dumbbells on your shoulder by holding on to dumbbells with elbows facing forward. This will be your starting position. 
 Keeping your head facing forward, your back straight, and your chest high, squat down by bending your hips back while allowing knees to come forward slightly, keeping your back straight and knees pointed in the same direction as your feet. Descend until your thighs are at parallel, or just past parallel to floor. 
 To return to the starting position, extend your knees and hips until your legs are straight. Repeat for the recommended number of reps.
