Chest Push from 3 point stance
Begin in a three point stance, squatted down with your back flat and one hand on the ground. Place the medicine ball directly in front of you.
 To begin, take your first step as you pull the ball to your chest, positioning both hands to prepare for the throw.
 As you execute the second step, explosively release the ball forward as hard as possible.
