Bosu Ball Crunch
  Lay with the small of your back against the round side of a Bosu ball. Your knees should be bent with your feet flat on the ground. Fold your arms across your chest. This will be your starting position. 
 Perform the movement by flexing the lumbar spine raising your torso. Do not flex the hips. 
 At the top of the motion pause, and then return to the starting position.
