Oblique Cable Crunch
 Connect a rope attachment to a high pulley cable and position the mat on the floor in front of you.
 Take the rope with both hands and kneel approximately 1-2 feet from the column. Position the rope behind your head; your hands being next to your ears. This will be your starting position.
 Keeping your hands in place, pull the rope downward in a crunching motion. As you flex the spine, twist to bring your elbow to the opposite knee.
 Pause briefly at the bottom of the motion, and then return to the starting position.
