Lateral Single-Arm Biceps Curl
Sit sideways on the glideboard and hold the handle with the hand closest to it, arm extended and palm facing up.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handle towards your shoulder and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your upper arm in the same position throughout.
