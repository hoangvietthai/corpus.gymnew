Stability Ball Pike With Knee Tuck
  Get in the push-up position with your hands shoulder-width apart, securing a large stability ball under your lower quads. Your body should be almost straight with your feet together off the floor. This is your start position.
 Contract your lower abs to raise your hips as high as you can, allowing the ball to roll down to your shins under control and bringing your knees into your chest.
 Push your knees back out and allow your abs to relax to roll the ball back in the reverse direction.
 Repeat for the required number of reps.
