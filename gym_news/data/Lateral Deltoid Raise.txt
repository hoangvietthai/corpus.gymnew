Lateral Deltoid Raise
Lie on your back on the glideboard, knees bent and hold the handles down near your hips, arms fully extended, palms facing each other.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles outwardly towards the level of your shoulders and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms fully extended throughout (or keep the small bend in your elbows constant).
