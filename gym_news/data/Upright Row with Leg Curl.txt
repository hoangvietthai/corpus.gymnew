Upright Row with Leg Curl
Sit on the top end of the glideboard and hold the handles above your knees, arms extended, palms facing down and ankles attached using the wing attachment.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles up towards your shoulders while curling your legs and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your back straight throughout.
