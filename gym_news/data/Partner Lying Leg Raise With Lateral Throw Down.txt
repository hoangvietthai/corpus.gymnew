Partner Lying Leg Raise With Lateral Throw Down
  Lie supine on the floor with your feet together; your partner should position one foot on either side of your head and stand upright with his knees slightly bent. Grasp your partner's ankles to stabilize your torso. This will be your starting position.
 With a slight bend in your knees, do a reverse-crunch movement, raising your feet toward your partner while lifting your hips off the floor.
 Your partner should grab your ankles and push your feet to one side or the other. Donâ€™t allow your feet to contact the floor to keep tension on the muscle.
 Bring your legs back to the center and repeat to the opposite side.
