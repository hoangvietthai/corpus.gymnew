Dumbbell Rear Delt Row
  Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. With the knees slightly bent, flex at the hip to lean forward. Ensure that your back is straight and stays that way for the duration of the exercise. Allow your arms to hang perpendicular to the floor, with the wrists pronated and the elbows pointed to your sides. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by flexing the elbows and transversely extending the shoulder, rowing the dumbbells toward your torso. Your shoulders should stay retracted, squeezing your scapulae together throughout the movement. The upper arms should be perpendicular to your torso.
 Continue the row until the elbows are inside of 90 degrees, contracting your shoulders as you pause at the top.
 Return to the starting position, taking care to maintain both shoulder and spinal positioning. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
