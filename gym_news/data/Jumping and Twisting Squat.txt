Jumping and Twisting Squat
Lie on your back on the glideboard with your feet on the squat stand, knees at 90 degree angles, rotated out slightly to one side.
Slide the glideboard up by jumping slightly off the squat stand while realigning yourself and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Breathe out while jumping and breathe in while returning to starting position.
