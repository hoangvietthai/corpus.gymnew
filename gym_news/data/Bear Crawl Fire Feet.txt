Bear Crawl Fire Feet
 Bend down so that your hands are on the ground and your feet hip-distance a part. Your shoulders should be stacked over your wrists, your knees bent to 90 degrees, your back flat, and abs engaged. This will be your starting position. 
 Keeping your hands in contact with the ground, pick up your feet rapidly, like youâ€™re running. Make sure to hold your â€œbear crawlâ€ position throughout the exercise, keeping your back flat and core tight. 
 Continue for the recommended duration.
