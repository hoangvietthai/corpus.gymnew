Double Leg Butt Kick
Begin standing with your knees slightly bent.
 Quickly squat a short distance, flexing the hips and knees, and immediately extend to jump for maximum vertical height.
 As you go up, tuck your heels by flexing the knees, attempting to touch the buttocks.
 Finish the motion by landing with the knees only partially bent, using your legs to absorb the impact.
