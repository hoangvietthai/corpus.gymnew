Forward Band Walk
  Position a band around your lower legs. The resistance can be applied closer to the knees for an easier movement or around the ankles or feet for a more advanced movement.
 With the band in place, assume an athletic standing position, with the knees and hips slightly bent, feet shoulder-width apart, and the head and chest up. This is your starting position.
 Staying low, take a slow, lengthy forward step. After completing the movement, follow with the opposite leg, stepping in front of the lead foot. Step slowly, resisting the band. Keep the feet shoulder-width apart to maintain band tension.
 Continue to step forward in this manner to complete the set for the desired number of repetitions.
