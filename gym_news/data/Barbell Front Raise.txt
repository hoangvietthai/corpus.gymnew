Barbell Front Raise
  Adopt a pronated, shoulder-width grip on the barbell from a standing position.
 Allow your arms to hang straight down to mid thigh with the elbows extended. Your head should face forward, with your shoulders back and your chest up. Maintain a neutral spine and contract your abs to provide core support. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by flexing the shoulder, raising the weight straight out in front of you. Keep the elbows extended and the wrist neutral throughout the movement. Continue the upward movement of the arms until the barbell is just above shoulder height.
 At the top of the motion, pause briefly, and then slowly return to the starting position.
