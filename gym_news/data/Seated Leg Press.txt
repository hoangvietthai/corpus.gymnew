Seated Leg Press
  Adjust the bottom position of the machine and seat yourself.
 Select an appropriate load for your training, and then plant your feet a little wider than shoulder width on the platform. Grasp the handles, maintaining good spinal position with your chest up and your head looking forward. This will be your starting position.
 Driving through the heels of your feet, extend through the hips and knees to push the sled upward. Do not lock out your knees.
 After holding the top position for a movement, return to the starting position without fully returning the weight to the stack.
