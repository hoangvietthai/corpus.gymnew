Shoulder Tap
 Get into a push-up position with your arms fully extended, your body in a straight line, and up on your toes. This will be your starting position.
 Quickly bring one hand up to tap the opposite-side shoulder, placing that hand back on the floor before repeating to the opposite side. Concurrently your body will slightly shift from one side to the other to better maintain balance. Move back and forth for the designated number of reps.
