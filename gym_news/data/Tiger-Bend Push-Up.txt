Tiger-Bend Push-Up
 Begin in the top position of a push-up: arms extended, back and neck in a straight line, and core tight with your hands slightly wider than shoulder width. This will be your starting position.
 Lower yourself to a bottom push-up position with your chest slightly above the floor. Rock backwards by bringing your elbows back and forearms to the ground, pushing through your palms. Your hips may rise slightly as you move back. This is OK. 
 Transition back to the bottom push-up position by rocking forward. Then, push up to the starting position. This is one repetition.
 Repeat for the recommended number of repetitions.
