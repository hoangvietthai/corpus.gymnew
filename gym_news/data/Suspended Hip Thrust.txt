Suspended Hip Thrust
  Lie on your back in front of suspension straps adjusted to 18 to 24 inches off of the ground. Place your feet in the straps, keeping your knees bent. This will be your starting position.
 To perform the movement, raise your hips off the floor to full extension, pushing down through your feet. Pause at the top of the motion before returning to the starting position.
