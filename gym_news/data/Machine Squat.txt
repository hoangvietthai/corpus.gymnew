Machine Squat
 Adjust the weight to an appropriate load for your training. 
 With a shoulder-width stance, squat under the shoulder pads and adjust the machine to the appropriate height. Move to a standing position with your back slightly arched, chest up, and head looking forward. This will be your starting position. 
 Lower your torso by flexing the hips and the knees. 
 Continue until you are below parallel, and then reverse direction by extending the hips and the knees.
