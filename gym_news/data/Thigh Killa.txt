Thigh Killa
 Begin in a standing position with your feet hip-distance apart and your hands behind your head. Descend into a squat position by bending at the knees and hips. This will be your starting position. 
 Take two small jumps out, then two small jumps back in, making sure that your feet never come closer than hip-distance.
 Throughout the entire movement, youâ€™ll want to stay in the squat position, keeping your hips back, butt down, and chest up. 
 Continue for the recommended time or number of reps.
