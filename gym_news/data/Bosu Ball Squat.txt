Bosu Ball Squat
  Stand on the flat side of a Bosu ball, with a shoulder-width stance. Maintain good spinal position with your chest up and head looking forward. This will be your starting position. 
 Flex the knees and hips to lower your body, keeping your knees aligned with your feet and hips. Squat as deep as flexibility allows. Do not allow your knees to cave or allow your thoracic spine to flex.
 Pause at the bottom of the motion, and then return to the starting position by extending at the knees and hips.
