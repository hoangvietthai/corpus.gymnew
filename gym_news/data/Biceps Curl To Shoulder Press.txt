Biceps Curl To Shoulder Press
  Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. Your arms should be hanging at your sides with your palms facing forward. Look directly ahead, keeping your chest up, with your feet shoulder-width apart. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by flexing the elbows to curl the weight. Do not use momentum or flex through the shoulder, instead use a controlled motion. 
 Execute the pressing movement by extending the arm, flexing and abducting the shoulder to rotate the arm as you press above your head. 
 Pause at the top of the motion before reversing the movement to return to the starting position. Complete the desired number of repetitions before switching to the opposite side.
