Jacknife Sit-Up
Lie down on your back with your feet pressed against the squat stand and extend your arms up in line with your body.
Roll your upper body up until your lower back no longer touches the glideboard and until your arms are parallel to your legs and lower yourself down after a short pause.
Try to keep your back, legs and arms straight throughout.
