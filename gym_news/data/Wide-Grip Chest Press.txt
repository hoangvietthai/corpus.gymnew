Wide-Grip Chest Press
Sit on the glideboard with your knees bent and hold the handles with your hands on each side of your chest, palms facing down and elbows bent.
Slide the glideboard up by pushing on the handles straight forward and away from each other and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your forearms parallel to the floor throughout.
