Row with Hyperextension
Sit on the glideboard with your legs fully extended and crouch down to hold the handles with your hands, arms fully extended in front of you.
Slide the glideboard up while raising your upper body up by pulling the handles towards the sides of your navel and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Breathe out while raising yourself and breathe in while lowering yourself back.
