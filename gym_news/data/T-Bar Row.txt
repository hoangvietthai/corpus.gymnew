T-Bar Row
  Load the bar to an appropriate weight for your training. Stand astride the bar and bend at the hips to take a pronated grip on the handles.
 Ensure that your back remains flat, and then remove the weight from the rests, letting the bar hang at arms length. This will be your starting position.
 Perform the movement by flexing the elbows and retracting the shoulder blades, pulling the weight to your chest.
 After a brief pause at the top of the motion, return to the starting position.
