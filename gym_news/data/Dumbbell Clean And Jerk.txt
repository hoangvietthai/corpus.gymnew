Dumbbell Clean And Jerk
Hold a dumbbell down by your side with a neutral grip. Clean the dumbbell to your shoulder by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the dumbbell towards your shoulder. Make sure to keep you hand in the neutral position and your elbow pointed forward. 
 Dip your body by bending the knees, keeping your torso upright.
 Immediately reverse direction, driving through the heels, in essence jumping to create momentum. As you do so, press the dumbbell overhead to lockout by extending the arms, using your body's momentum to move the weight.
 Lower the dumbbell slowly to the starting position, allowing your knees to bend slightly to lessen the blow. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.
