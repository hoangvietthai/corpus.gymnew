Single-Leg Hop Progression
Arrange a line of cones in front of you. Assume a relaxed standing position, balanced on one leg. Raise the knee of your opposite leg. This will be your starting position.
 Hop forward, jumping and landing with the same leg over the cone.
 Use a countermovement jump to hop from cone to cone.
 At the end, turn around and go back on the other leg.
