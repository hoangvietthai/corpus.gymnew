Biceps Curl with Leg Curl
Sit on the top end of the glideboard and hold the handles with your hands above your knees, arms extended, palms facing up and attach your ankles to the wing attachment.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles towards your shoulders while curling your legs and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your upper arms in the same position throughout.
