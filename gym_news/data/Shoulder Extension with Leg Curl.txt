Shoulder Extension with Leg Curl
Sit on the top end of the glideboard and hold the handles near your knees, arms extended, palms facing down and ankles attached to the wing attachment.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles straight back until your arms are perpendicular to the floor while curling your legs and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms fully extended throughout (or keep the small bend in your elbows constant).
