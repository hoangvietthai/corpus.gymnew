Standing Palms-In Dumbbell Press
 Start by having a dumbbell in each hand with your arm fully extended to the side using a neutral grip. Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other.  Now slowly lift the dumbbells up until you create a 90 degree angle with your arms. 
 Your forearms should be perpendicular to the floor. This the starting position.
 Continue to maintain a neutral grip throughout the entire exercise.  Slowly lift the dumbbells up until your arms are fully extended.  
 While inhaling lower the weights down until your arm is at a 90 degree angle again.
 Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
