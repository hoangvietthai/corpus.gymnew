Back Fly
Sit on the top edge of the glideboard and hold the handles with your hands, arms extended out in front of you.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling on the handles towards the sides of your body and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms fully extended throughout (or keep the small bend in your elbows constant).
