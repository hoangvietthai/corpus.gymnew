Single-Leg Squat Kneeling
Kneel on one knee on the glideboard with the other foot resting against the squat stand, its knee bent.
Slide the glideboard up by straightening your leg and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Breathe out while straightening your leg and breathe in while returning to starting position.
