Front Dumbbell Raise Using Towel
 Roll up a small towel and grasp it by the ends. Encircle the towel around a dumbbellâ€™s handle pressed up against the inner side of the upper plate, keeping your hands together to ensure the weight doesnâ€™t slip through the loop. Let your arms hang down directly in front of you. This will be your starting position.
 With your arms extended, do a front raise, bringing your hands up to about eye level in a smooth motion. Lower under control and repeat for reps.
