Defensive Slide
 Begin in an athletic position with your knees bent and your chest up. Your arms should be in front of your body.
 Shuffle laterally to the right by stepping sideways with your right foot and bringing the left to match.
 As the left foot meets your right, shuffle sideways again. 
 Once you've taken 2-3 shuffles, change direction and move to the left.
 Repeat.
