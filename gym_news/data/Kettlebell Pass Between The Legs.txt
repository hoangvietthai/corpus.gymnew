Kettlebell Pass Between The Legs
 Place one kettlebell between your legs and take a comfortable stance. Bend over by pushing your butt out and keeping your back flat.
 Pick up a kettlebell and pass it to your other hand between your legs, in the fashion of a W. Go back and forth for several repetitions.
