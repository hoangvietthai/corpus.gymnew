Wide Grip Front Deltoid Raise
Sit on the glideboard, knees slightly bent and hold the handles down below your buttocks, arms extended and palms facing back.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles forward and outward until your arms are parallel to the floor and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms fully extended throughout (or keep the small bend in your elbows constant).
