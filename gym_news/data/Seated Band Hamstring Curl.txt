Seated Band Hamstring Curl
Secure a band close to the ground and place a bench a couple feet away from it.
 Seat yourself on the bench and secure the band behind your ankles, beginning with your legs straight. This will be your starting position.
 Flex the knees, bringing your feet towards the bench. You may need to lean back slightly to keep your feet from striking the floor. 
Pause at the completion of the movement, and then slowly return to the starting position.
