Cross Crunch
 Begin lying on your back with your knees bent.
 Raise your shoulders off the floor, but don't sit all the way up. Your abdominals should be flexed.
 From this position, reach toward your right knee with your left hand. When your left hand touches your knee,  bring it down toward your hip as you reach toward your left knee with your right hand.
 Continue to alternate reaches while keeping your abdominals flexed.
