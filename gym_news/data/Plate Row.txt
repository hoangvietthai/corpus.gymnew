Plate Row
  Stack the needed number of plates on top of a small plate on the ground, allowing you to easily grip the rims.
 Adopt a shoulder-width stance in front of the plates. Bend at the hip with your knees slightly bent, keeping your back flat. Grab the weights from the side and let them hang below your chest, arms extended. This will be your starting positioning.
 Maintaining a flat back, pull the weights to your chest by flexing the elbows. Do not jerk the weight.
 Return the weight to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
