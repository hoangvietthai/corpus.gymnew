Single-Leg Squat On Side
Lie sideways on the glideboard with one foot on the squat stand, its knee at a 90 degree angle and the other off the squat stand, knee bent.
Slide the glideboard up by straightening your leg and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Breathe out while straightening your leg and breathe in while returning to starting position.
