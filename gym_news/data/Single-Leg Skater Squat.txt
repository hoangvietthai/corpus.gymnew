Single-Leg Skater Squat
 Begin with a pad or BOSU ball placed directly behind you and your feet hip-width apart.
 Transition your weight to your dominate leg and lift the opposite leg slightly off the floor.  Keep your neck neutral and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.
 Slowly descend by pushing your hips and butts backwards. Continue descending until the knee of your bent and raised leg lightly touches the pad or BOSU ball.
 Upon contact, push through the heel of your stationary leg and return to the starting position. This is one repetition.
 Repeat for the recommended number of repetitions and then switch legs.
