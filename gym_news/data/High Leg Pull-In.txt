High Leg Pull-In
Kneel down on the glideboard, grasp the toe bar with your hands and push your body up the rail while keeping your thighs and upper body extended on the same line.
Pull yourself back towards the toe bar while keeping your arms and upper body fully extended and push yourself back up after a short pause.
Be careful not to back yourself too far out up to a point where you would lose balance.
