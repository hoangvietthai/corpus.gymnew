Wide-Hands Push-Up
  Get in the push-up position on your toes with your hands outside your shoulders. Your body should be as straight as possible, maintaining the neutral alignment of your head. This is your start position.
 Allow your elbows to break as you lower your body toward the floor, keeping your body as straight as possible. Stop short of touching the floor, pushing your elbows out to your sides.
 Press back through your hands to full arm extension and repeat for the required number of reps.
