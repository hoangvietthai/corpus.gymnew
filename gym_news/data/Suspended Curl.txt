Suspended Curl
  Adjust the straps to put the handles around chest height. Facing the suspension system, grasp the handles with a supinated (underhand) grip. Keeping your body rigid, lean back allowing your elbows to straighten. This will be your starting position. 
 Perform the movement by flexing the elbows, pulling yourself upward. Do not cheat or compensate, using only your biceps to execute the exercise.  At the top of the motion, pause, and then lower yourself to the staring position.
