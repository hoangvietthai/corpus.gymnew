Biceps Curl
Sit on the top end of the glideboard and hold the handles with your arms extended above your knees, palms facing up.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles towards your shoulders and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your upper arms in the same position throughout.
