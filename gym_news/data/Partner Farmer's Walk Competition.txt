Partner Farmer's Walk Competition
  Place two dumbbells on the floor in front of you, making sure you have enough open space to walk. If you canâ€™t reach the floor safely without rounding your back, elevate the weights off the floor. (When doing this as a competition, start side by side with your partner and make sure thereâ€™s enough room for both of you.)
 Squat down keeping your back flatâ€”donâ€™t bend overâ€”and grasp the weights with a neutral grip. Stand back up by extending at the hips and knees; this will be your starting position.
 Keeping the weights at your sides, walk forward as far as you can; if necessary turn around and return the other way. Try to beat your partner for both distance and time.
 Descend into a squat to lower the weights back to the floor.
