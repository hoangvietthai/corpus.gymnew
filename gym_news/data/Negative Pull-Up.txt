Negative Pull-Up
 Standing under a bar, or on a box if necessary, jump up, grabbing the bar with a slightly wider than shoulder-width grip. Using the momentum from your jump, pull yourself upwards until your chin is above the bar. This is your starting position.
 Slowly lower yourself, keeping a tight core and focus on the lats. Allow your arms to slowly extend as you inch closer to the ground. Aim for 3 to 5 seconds until your arms are fully extended.
 Upon reaching full extension, let go of the bar and return to the ground.
 Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.
