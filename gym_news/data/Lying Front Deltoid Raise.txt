Lying Front Deltoid Raise
Lie on your back on the glideboard, knees bent and hold the handles down near your hips, arms fully extended, plams facing each down.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles up until your arms are perpendicular to the floor and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms fully extended throughout (or keep the small bend in your elbows constant).
