Double Under
 From a standing position, grasp a rope handle in each hand and place your feet in front of the jump rope, so the rope rests on the ground behind your heels. Hold your arms down at arm's length, tucking your elbows into your sides and bring your hands up so your forearms are parallel to the ground. This will be your starting position.
 Begin the exercise by swinging the rope up and over your head, utilizing wrist and shoulder rotation; jump as the rope approaches your feet.
 Every third rotation, jump a little higher and whip the wrists as fast as you can, causing the rope to pass under you twice before the jump is complete.
