Rockers (Pullover To Press) Straight Bar
  Lay on a flat bench with your feet flat on the floor. Hold a barbell on your chest with a shoulder-width, pronated grip. This will be your starting position.
 Keeping the elbows bent to about 90 degrees, rotate the barbell over and behind your head.
 Return the barbell to your chest, again keeping the elbows again fixed at the same angle.
 Press the barbell straight up by extending the elbows, and then return the weight to the starting position.
