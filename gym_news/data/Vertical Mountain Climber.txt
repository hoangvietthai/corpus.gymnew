Vertical Mountain Climber
 From a standing position, raise your left hand reaching as high as you can, while driving your right knee up in a similar movement to a traditional mountain climber. 
 Switch by pulling down with your left hand and reaching high with your right hand. At the same time, let your right foot fall to the floor, then drive with your lift knee up.
 Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
