Tall Muscle Snatch
  Begin with a loaded barbell held at the mid-thigh position with a wide grip. The feet should be directly below the hips with the feet turned out as needed. The knees should be slightly bent. Raise the upper arms until they are parallel to the ground. This will be the starting position. 
 Begin the movement by driving through the front of the heels pulling yourself under the bar into the receiving position. Extend your arms overhead as you descend into a full squat. 
 After pausing at the bottom of the receiving position, extend the hips and knees to rise to a full standing position holding the weight overhead. 
 Return to the starting position lowering the weight under control.
