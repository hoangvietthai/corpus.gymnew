Kettlebell 3-Point Extension
 Place a kettlebell on the ground, about legs-distance away from your body. Start on the floor in a seated position with your hands placed behind you slightly wider than shoulder-distance apart. Keeping your back straight, pull your knees in towards your chest. This will be your starting position.  
 Extend your legs out to one side of the kettlebell. As you extend your legs out, flex your elbows and lean back. Pull your knees back in as you bring your chest in towards your legs. Next extend your legs straight out over the kettlebell. Bring your knees back in towards your chest, and then extend them out to the other side of the kettlebell. This is one repetition. Complete for the recommended number of repetitions.
