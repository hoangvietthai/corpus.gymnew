Split Squat With Kettlebells
  Position yourself into a staggered stance with the rear foot elevated and front foot forward. Hold a kettlebell in each hand, letting them hang by your side. This will be your starting position.
 Begin by descending, flexing your knee and hip to lower your body down. Maintain good posture throughout the movement. Keep the front knee in line with your foot as your perform the exercise. 
 At the bottom of the movement drive through the heel to extend the knee and hip to return to the starting position.
