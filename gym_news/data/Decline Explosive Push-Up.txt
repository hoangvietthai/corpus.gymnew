Decline Explosive Push-Up
 Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart while holding your torso up at arms length. Move your feet up to a box or bench. This will be your starting position.
 Next, lower yourself downward until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale.
 At the bottom, reverse the motion by pushing yourself up through elbow extension as quickly as possible. Attempt to push your upper body up until your hands leave the ground. 
 Return to the starting position and repeat the exercise.
