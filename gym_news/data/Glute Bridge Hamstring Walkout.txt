Glute Bridge Hamstring Walkout
 Begin in a supine position on the floor. Bend both knees, placing your feet flat on the ground with your feet close to your glutes. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the exercise by extending the hips, driving your hips from the floor to perform a glute bridge. At the top of the motion, begin taking short, alternating steps. Continue until your legs are fully extended and your weight is supported on your heels.
 Hold the walkout position briefly, and then alternate steps back in to return to the bridge position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
