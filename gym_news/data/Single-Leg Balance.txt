Single-Leg Balance
 Begin in a standing position with your right foot slightly raised from the ground. You should be looking forward with your right arm just in front of your torso. This will be your starting position. 
 Initiate the exercise by flexing the hip, hinging your torso down and keeping your legs slightly bent. Do not round your back. Extend your free leg backward for balance as you reach for your left foot with your right hand. 
 After a pause, slowly return to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions before switching to the opposite side.
