Lateral Hop 4 Times To Sprint
 Begin this exercise by standing with your feet hip-width apart and holding light weight dumbbells down by your side.  This will be your starting position. 
 While holding on to the dumbbells, hop back and forth over an imaginary line four times before turning to your left and sprinting about 20 feet. 
 As soon as you finish your sprint, repeat the exercise by performing 4 more lateral hops, turning to your left, and sprinting back to your original starting position. 
 Complete for recommended number of reps or time.
