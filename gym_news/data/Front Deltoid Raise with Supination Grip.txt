Front Deltoid Raise with Supination Grip
Sit on the glideboard, knees slightly bent and hold the handles down below your buttocks, arms extended and palms facing forward.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles forward until your arms are parallel to the floor and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms fully extended throughout (or keep the small bend in your elbows constant).
