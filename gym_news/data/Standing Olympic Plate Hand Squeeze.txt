Standing Olympic Plate Hand Squeeze
 To begin, stand straight while holding a weight plate by the ridge at arm's length in each hand using a neutral grip (palms facing in).  You feet should be shoulder width apart from each other.  This will be your starting position.
 Lower the plates until the fingers are nearly extended but can still hold weights. Inhale as you lower the plates.
  Now raise the plates back to the starting position as you exhale by closing your hands.
 Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions prescribed in your program.
