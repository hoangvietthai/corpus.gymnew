Neck Bridge Supine
 Begin in a supine position on the floor. Bend both knees, placing your feet flat on the ground. This will be your starting position. 
 Initiate the exercise by extending the hips, driving your hips from the floor to perform a glute bridge. As your back comes off of the ground, transition to supporting your weight on your head. 
 Perform this movement slowly, backing off if any serious discomfort is felt. Hold the neck bridge for a period of time, and then carefully return your hips to the floor.
