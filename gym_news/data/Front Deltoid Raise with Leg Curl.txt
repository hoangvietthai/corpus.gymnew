Front Deltoid Raise with Leg Curl
Sit on the top end of the glideboard and hold the handles down near your thighs, arms extended, plams facing back and ankles attached to the wing attachment.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles straight up in front of you while curling your legs and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms fully extended throughout (or keep the small bend in your elbows constant).
