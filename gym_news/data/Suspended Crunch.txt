Suspended Crunch
  Adjust the straps so the handles are at an appropriate height. From a push up position in front of the suspension system, place your feet into the handles. Begin with your legs straight and your hips extended. This will be your starting position. 
 Initiate the movement by flexing the hips and knees, drawing your knees towards your chest. Pause during the peak contraction, and then return to the starting position.
