Slide Jump Shot
 Begin in an athletic position with your knees bent and your chest up.
 Take a lateral step to the right and then bring your feet together.
 As soon as your feet come together, jump up with your arms in the air as if you were shooting a basketball.
 When you come down, take a lateral step to the left and repeat the movement.  Move as quickly as you can.
