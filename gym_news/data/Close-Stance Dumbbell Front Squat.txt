Close-Stance Dumbbell Front Squat
 Position your legs using a very narrow stance (feet a few inches apart) with the toes slightly pointed out and knees slightly bent. Hold a dumbbell (hand on each end) at chest level, with your elbows tucked inwards to your side. Keep your neck neutral and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.
 Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
 Once you reach your bottom position, begin to push through your heels to ascend upwards and return to the starting position.
 Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.
