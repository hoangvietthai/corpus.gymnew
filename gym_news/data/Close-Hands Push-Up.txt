Close-Hands Push-Up
  Get in the push-up position on your toes with your hands directly under your shoulders. Your body should be as straight as possible, maintaining the neutral alignment of your head. This is your start position.
 Allow your elbows to break as you lower your body toward the floor but donâ€™t allow it to touch. Keep your body as straight as possible. Your elbows should be pointing rearward, bent about 90 degrees, at the bottom position.
 Press back up through your hands to full arm extension. 
 Repeat for the required number of reps.
