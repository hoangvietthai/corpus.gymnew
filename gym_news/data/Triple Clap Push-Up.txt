Triple Clap Push-Up
 Get into the push-up position, keeping your body in a straight line. This will be your starting position. 
 Descend and then explosively push upward plyometric style, elevating your upper body as high as you can off the floor. As you rise up, in a fluid but fast motion bring your hands together in front of you and clap. Continue the motion so that youâ€™re clapping behind your torso at the apex of the movement, then once again in front of you before re-setting your hands on the floor to catch yourself. 
 Smoothly descend into the next rep and repeat.
