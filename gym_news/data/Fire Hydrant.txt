  Position yourself on your hands and knees on the ground. This will be your starting position.
 Keeping the knee in a bent position, abduct the femur, moving your knee away from the midline of the body.
 Pause at the top of the motion, and then slowly return to the starting position.
 Perform this slowly for a number of repetitions, and repeat on the other side.
