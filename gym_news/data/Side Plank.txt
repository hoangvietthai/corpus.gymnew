Side Plank
Rest on one side on your forearm (elbow at 90 degrees), body fully extended with your feet against the base of the machine.
Bring the arm that is free up above your head and extend it so that is parallel to the mat and hold for a few seconds before bringing it back.
Only the arm that is free should be moving throughout the exercise.
