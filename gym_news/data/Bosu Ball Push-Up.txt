Bosu Ball Push-Up
  Assume a prone position with your body straight supporting your upper body with a wide grip on the flat side of the Bosu ball. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by flexing the elbows lowering your torso. Do not allow your hips to rise or to sag. 
 Pause at the bottom of the motion, and then extend the elbows to return to the starting position.
