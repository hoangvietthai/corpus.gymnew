Suspended Back Fly
 Adjust the straps to place the handles at the appropriate height. 
 Grasp the handles with both hands with your palms facing each other. 
 With your arms extended, lean back and adjust your relative position to change the degree of difficulty. With your body straight and your arms extended, you will be in the starting position. 
 Abduct the shoulder while keeping the elbow slightly bent to pull yourself up to perform a reverse fly motion.
