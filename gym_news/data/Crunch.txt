Crunch
Lie down on your back with your feet pressed against the squat stand and your hands against your ears.
Roll your shoulder blades up from the gildeboard while keeping your lower back in contact with it and lower yourself back down after a short pause.
To avoid pulling your neck with your hands, look straight up instead of looking at your knees.
