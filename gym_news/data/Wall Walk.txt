Wall Walk
 Begin in a push-up position with your feet against the wall.
 Walk your feet up the wall while simultaneously walking your hands back towards the wall. Keep your core as tight as possible. Walk up until you are as flat to the wall as you can get.
 Walk your hands away from the wall and your feet down the wall until you are back in the push-up position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
