Low Leg Pull-In
Kneel down on the glideboard, grasp the base of the machine with your hands and push your body up the rail so that your body is fully extended.
Pull yourself back towards your hands by bending your hips and knees and push yourself back up after a short pause.
Keep your arms extended and perpendicular to the floor throughout.
