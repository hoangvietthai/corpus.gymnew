Inclined Crunch with Feet Attached
Lie down on your back with your head down, feet attched to the wing attachment, knees slightly bent.
Roll your shoulder blades up from the glideboard while keeping your lower back in contact with it and lower yourself back down after a short pause.
To avoid pulling your neck with your hands, look straight up instead of looking at your knees.
