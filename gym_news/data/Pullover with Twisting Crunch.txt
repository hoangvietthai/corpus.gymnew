Pullover with Twisting Crunch
Lie on your back on the glideboard, knees bent and hold the handles with your hands, arms extended up in line with your body.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling one handle down towards the opposite thigh while at the same time rolling your shoulder blades up and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms straight throughout.
