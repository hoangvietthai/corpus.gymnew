One-Arm Push-Up
 Start in a push-up position but kick one leg as far out to your side as you can. Elevate one hand and place it on your thigh just above your knee. In this start position you should be able to balance yourself like a tripod. 
 Descend into a push-up so that your same-side pec is just off the floor, keeping your opposite-side shoulder slightly elevated for better balance. 
 Press strongly back up to full arm extension. Repeat for reps then switch to the opposite side.
