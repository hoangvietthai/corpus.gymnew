Chest Push with Run Release
Begin in an athletic stance with the knees bent, hips back, and back flat. Hold the medicine ball near your legs. This will be your starting position.
 While taking your first step draw the medicine ball into your chest.
 As you take the second step, explosively push the ball forward, immediately sprinting for 10 yards after the release. If you are really fast, you can catch your own pass!
