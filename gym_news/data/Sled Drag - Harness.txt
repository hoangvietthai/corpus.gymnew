Sled Drag - Harness
To begin, load the sled with the desired weight and attach the pulling strap. You can pull with handles, use a harness, or attach the pulling strap to a weight belt.
 Whether pulling forwards or backwards, lean in the direction of travel and progress by extending through the hips and knees.
