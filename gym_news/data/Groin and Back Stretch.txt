Groin and Back Stretch
Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet together. 
Interlock your fingers behind your head. This will be your starting position.
 Curl downwards, bringing your elbows to the inside of your thighs. After a brief pause, return to the starting position with your head up and your back straight. Repeat for 10-20 repetitions.
