Lateral Chest Fly
Sit sideways on the glideboard with your legs extended out and hold one handle with the hand closest to it, arm extended out with your elbow only slightly bent.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handle towards the front of your chest and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep the small bend in your elbows constant throughout.
