Pullover with Squat
Lie on your back on the glideboard, knees bent, feet against the squat stand and hold the handles with your hands, arms extended up in line with your body.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles down towards your thighs while at the same time extending your legs and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms straight throughout.
