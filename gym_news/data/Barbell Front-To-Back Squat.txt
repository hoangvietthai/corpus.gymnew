Barbell Front-To-Back Squat
 Deadlift a barbell off the ground and clean it to a racked position. If you are using a squat rack set it just below shoulder height and rest a barbell on top of your deltoids, pushing into the clavicles, and lightly touching the throat. Your hands should be in a clean grip, touching the bar only with your fingers to help keep it in position.
 Position your feet into a shoulder-width apart stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head and elbows up at all times. Your triceps should remain parallel to the ground. Keep a neutral neck and flat back. This will be your starting position.
 Descend into a squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. 
 Drive up through your heels, pushing your feet and knees out. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe, until you have returned to the starting position. Then, push upwards by fully extending your arms overhead and move the bar to a back squat position (lying across your upper traps). 
 Then, complete a back squat by pushing your hips and butt backwards. Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. 
 Drive up through your heels, pushing your feet and knees out. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe, until you have returned to the top position.
 Return the bar to a front squat position by pushing upwards and fully extending your arms and moving the bar back to the top of your deltoids. This is one repetition.
 Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.
