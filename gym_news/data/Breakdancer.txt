Breakdancer
 Bend down so that your hands are on the ground and your feet hip-distance a part. Your shoulders should be stacked over your wrists, your knees bent to 90 degrees, your back flat, and abs engaged. This will be your starting position. 
 Lift one hand off the ground and bring your opposite foot off the floor. Rotate your hips as you bring your leg through kicking it out to the opposite side. 
 Rotate your hips back and kick your opposite foot through while switching hand placement on the ground.  
 Repeat for the recommended number of repetitions.
