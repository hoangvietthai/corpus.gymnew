Single-Leg Squat
Lie on your back on the glideboard with one foot on the squat stand with its knee at a 90 degree angles and the other leg slightly elevated and extended.
Slide the glideboard up by straightening your leg and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Breathe out while straightening your leg and breathe in while returning to starting position.
