Ice Skater
  Begin in a standing position with your feet shoulder-width apart. You should be looking directly forward, with your chest up, knees and hips unlocked, and your back straight. This will be your starting position.
 Begin the exercise by jumping to the right with a slight bend in your knees.
 Next, in the same motion, reach down and toward the outside of your right foot with your left hand. Perform this same movement on the opposite side. 
 Repeat this movement for the desired number of reps.
