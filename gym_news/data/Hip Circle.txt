Hip Circle
  Brace yourself a couple of feet back from a sturdy object and stand on one foot, knee unlocked and leaning forward slightly.
 Standing on one leg, lift up on to your toes while keeping your other foot off the ground. This will be your starting position.
 In a circular motion, rotate your entire leg both forwards and backwards for a number of repetitions to loosen up the hips.
 Keep your foot off the floor the entire time. Repeat for the opposite side.
