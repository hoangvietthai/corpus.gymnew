Kettlebell One-Legged Deadlift
Hold a kettlebell by the handle in one hand. Stand on one leg, on the same side that you hold the kettlebell.
 Keeping that knee slightly bent, perform a stiff legged deadlift by bending at the hip, extending your free leg behind you for balance. 
Continue lowering the kettlebell until you are parallel to the ground, and then return to the upright position.
