Triceps Plank Extension
  Assume a push-up position on the ground with a dumbbell in each hand. You should be supporting your body weight on your toes and hands keeping your torso straight. Your arms should be shoulder-width apart and fully extended. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by rowing a dumbbell to one side, pulling the upper arm parallel to your torso. Keep the arm fixed to your side, and then extend the elbow to perform a triceps extension.
 Reverse the movement and return the dumbbell to the ground adopting the start position once again. Alternate the movement between each side.
