Kneeling Triceps Extension
Kneel on the glideboard and hold the handles in front of your chest, elbows bent and palms facing down.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles back, straightening your arms and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your upper arms and upper body in the same position throughout.
