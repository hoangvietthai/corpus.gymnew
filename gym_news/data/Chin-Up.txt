Chin-Up
Lie prone on the glideboard and hold the wing attachment with your hands, arms extended and palms facing up.
Slide the glideboard up by curling your arms and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Breathe out while pulling yourself up and breathe in while returning to starting position.
