Side To Side Push-Up
 Assume a push-up position with your body straight, supported by your extended arms. Your hands should be outside of shoulder width. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by flexing the elbows and leaning to one side, lowering your torso to the ground.
 Return to the starting position by extending your elbows, pushing yourself back to center.
 On the next repetition lower yourself to the other side, again returning to the starting position after the rep is complete. Continue alternating until the set is finished.
