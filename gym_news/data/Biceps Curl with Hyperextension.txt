Biceps Curl with Hyperextension
Sit on the glideboard, legs extended and tilt your upper body forward to hold the handles above your ankles, arms extended and palms facing up.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles towards your shoudlers while raising your upper body and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Breathe out while pulling the handles and breathe in while returning to starting position.
