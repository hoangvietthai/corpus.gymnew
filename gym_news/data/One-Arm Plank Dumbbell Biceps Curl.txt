One-Arm Plank Dumbbell Biceps Curl
 Place a dumbbell on the ground and set-up in the up position of a push-up: arms extended, back and neck in a straight line, and core tight, so that your right hand is a few inches to the left of the dumbbell. Keep your feet shoulder width apart.
 Shift your weight to your left hand (and foot) as you grip the dumbbell in your right hand. This will be your starting position.
 Complete a biceps curl with the right arm by flexing at the elbow and curling upwards towards your shoulder. Lower your arm by fully extending it to the starting position. This is one repetition.
 Repeat for recommended number of repetitions and then switch arms.
