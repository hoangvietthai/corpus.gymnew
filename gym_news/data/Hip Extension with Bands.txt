Hip Extension with Bands
Secure one end of the band to the lower portion of a post and attach the other to one ankle.
 Facing the attachment point of the band, hold on to the column to stabilize yourself. 
Keeping your head and your chest up, move the resisted leg back as far as you can while keeping the knee straight.
 Return the leg to the starting position.
