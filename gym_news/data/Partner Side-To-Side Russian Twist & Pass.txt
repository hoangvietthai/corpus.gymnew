Partner Side-To-Side Russian Twist & Pass
  Balance your body weight on your hips with your legs semi-extended and off the floor. Lean back so your torso is at a 45-degree angle to the floor, making sure to keep your back straight and not rounded.  You should be sitting next to your partner, about 4 feet away.
 Hold a weighted medicine ball in your hands just above your chest. This will be your starting position.
 Rotate away from your partner, back to the inside, and then back to the outside before passing the ball to your partner. Make sure youâ€™re contracting your obliques to twist, not simply moving only at the shoulders.
 Each person should do three touches before passing the medicine ball back.
