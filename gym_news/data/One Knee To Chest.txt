One Knee To Chest
Start off by lying on the floor. 
 Extend one leg straight and pull the other knee to your chest. Hold under the knee joint to protect the kneecap.
 Gently tug that knee toward your nose. 
Switch sides. This stretches the buttocks and lower back of the bent leg and the hip flexor of the straight leg.
