Staggered Push-Up
 Assume a prone position with your body straight, supported by your extended arms and your toes. Your hands should be outside of shoulder width but staggered, with one being higher than the other. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by flexing the elbows, lowering your torso to the ground. Do not allow your hips to rise or to sag.
 Pause at the bottom of the motion, and then extend at the elbows to return to the starting position.
 At the completion of this set, reverse your hand position for the next round.
