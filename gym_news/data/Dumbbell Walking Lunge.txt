Dumbbell Walking Lunge
 Begin standing with your feet about hip-width apart and holding dumbbells in your hands down by your side. This will be your starting position.  
 Step forward with one leg, flexing the knees to drop your hips. Descend until your rear knee nearly touches the ground. Your posture should remain upright, and your front knee should be in line with your front foot. Do not allow your front knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint.
 Drive through the heel of your lead foot and extend both knees to raise yourself back up.
 Step forward with your rear foot, repeating the lunge on the opposite leg.
