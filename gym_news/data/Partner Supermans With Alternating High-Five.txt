Partner Supermans With Alternating High-Five
  Lie facedown on the floor about a 2 feet from your partner, shoulders and elbows bent about 90 degrees, feet about hip-width apart. Your bodies should mirror each otherâ€™s. This will be your starting position.
 Contracting your lower back, glutes, and hamstrings, simultaneously raise your feet and upper torso off the floor, crossing one hand over to tap your partner's hand.
 Lower back down to the starting position using control so all limbs touch the floor and repeat to the opposite side. Make sure to keep your head neutral so that itâ€™s aligned with your torso throughout the set.
