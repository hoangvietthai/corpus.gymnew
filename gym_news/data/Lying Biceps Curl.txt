Lying Biceps Curl
Lie on your back on the glideboard, knees bent, and hold the handles with your arms extended and lying on the mat, palms facing up.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles towards your shoulders and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your upper arms pressed against the slideboard throughout.
