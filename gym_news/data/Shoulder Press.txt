Shoulder Press
Lie face down on the glideboard, knees bent and grasp the press-up bars with your hands, elbows bent.
Slide the glideboard up by extending your arms (pushing yourself up) and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Breathe out while pushing and breathe in while returning to starting position.
