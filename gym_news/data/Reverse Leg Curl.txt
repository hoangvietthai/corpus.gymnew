Reverse Leg Curl
Lie on your back on the glideboard, hips and knees at 90 degree angles and rest your feet against the toe raise bar.
Raise your buttocks from up the glideboard by straightening your hips and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep a 90 degree angle in your knees throughout.
