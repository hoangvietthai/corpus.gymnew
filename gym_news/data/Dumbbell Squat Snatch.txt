Dumbbell Squat Snatch
 Start with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes pointing outward slightly. Position a dumbbell in front of your thigh with your knuckles facing forward. This will be your starting position.
 Squat down by bending at your knees and lower the dumbbell between your knees, keeping your arm straight and your shoulder over the dumbbell. Pull the dumbbell up by extending the hips and knees. Shrug your shoulders and pull the dumbbell upward with your arm, allowing your elbow to pull up to the side. 
 Aggressively pull your body under the dumbbell, catching the dumbbell with your arm extended overhead while moving into a squat position. The crease of your hips should be lower than the height of your knees. The movement is completed by standing up to full hip and knee extension with the weight held overhead. Bring the dumbbell back down to the starting position. This is one rep. 
 Complete for the recommended number of repetitions before switching sides.
