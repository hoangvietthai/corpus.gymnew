Diamond Push-Up
  Get in the modified push-up position on your knees but with your hands together and back flat. Spread your fingers so that your index fingers and thumbs form a diamond, and extend your arms. This is your start position.
 Allow your elbows to break, lowering your chest toward the floor while keeping your back flat.
 Press back up to full arm extension, repeating for the required number of reps.
 To make the movement more difficult, stay up on your toes rather than on your knees.
