High Knee Jog
 Begin in an athletic position with your knees bent, your feet shoulder-width apart, and your arms bent and at your sides.
 Flex the hip and bring your right knee up toward your belly button.
 As the right leg comes down, bring the left knee up. 
 Alternate lifting the knees high as you jog in place.
