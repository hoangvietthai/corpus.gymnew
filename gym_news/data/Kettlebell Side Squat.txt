Kettlebell Side Squat
 Begin in a standing position with your chest up and your feet hip-width apart. Bend your knees to pick up the kettlebell and swing it up to chest level. This will be your starting position. 
 Step one foot out to the side, bringing your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width. Bend at the knees and hips, pushing your hips back. Continue until your thighs are parallel to the ground. 
 Return to the starting position by extending at the hips and knees and repeat on the opposite side.
 Complete for the recommended number of repetitions.
