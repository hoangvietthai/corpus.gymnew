Triceps Extension
Lie on your back on the glideboard, knees bent and hold the handles with your hands above your shoulders, elbows bent and palms facing up.
Slide the glideboard up by pushing the handles forward towards your kness, straightening your arms and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your upper arms in the same position throughout.
