Trunk Rotation
Sit sideways on the glideboard, keep your legs extended up from the floor and hold the handles with both hands close to one another on your side.
While keeping the angles in your elbows still, pull the handles towards the other side of your trunk and allow yourself back to the starting position after a short pause.
Keep your back straight throughout.
