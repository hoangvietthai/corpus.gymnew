Alternating Leg Swing
  This warm-up move is done in an open area of the workout floor.
 Standing upright, take a few steps forward and kick one leg straight out in front of you as high as you can.
 Simultaneously extend the opposite-side arm out and touch your foot as you move forward.
 Take a few more steps and repeat to the opposite side.
