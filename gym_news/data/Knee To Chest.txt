Knee To Chest
 Stand erect with your feet hip-width apart, chest out and shoulders back, maintaining the natural curvature in your back. Your knees should be unlocked and arms by your sides. This is your start position. 
 Raise one knee as high as you can directly in front of you, keeping your weight on your back foot, and cusp your hands to gently lift and momentarily hold the top position. Keep your body upright without bending over.
 Disengage your hands and allow the foot to strike the floor in front of the other one, toes aiming directly forward.
 Step forward with your opposite leg, repeating the move to the other side, and continue moving forward for the required number of repetitions.
