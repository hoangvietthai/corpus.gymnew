Slow Jog
 Begin standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Your arms should be bent and at your sides.
 Lift your right knee up until it reaches your waist. Your left arm should swing forward while your right arm swings back.  Keep your left knee slightly bent and allow it to spring.
 Return your right foot to the ground as you lift your left knee.  Swing your right arm forward and your left arm back. Keep your right knee slightly bent and allow it to spring.
 Repeat.
