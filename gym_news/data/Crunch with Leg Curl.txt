Crunch with Leg Curl
Lie down on your back with your head down, feet attched to the wing attachment, knees slightly bent.
Roll your shoulder blades up from the glideboard while at the same time pulling yourself up closer to your feet by bending your knees and lower yourself back down after a short pause.
To avoid pulling your neck with your hands, look straight up instead of looking at your knees.
