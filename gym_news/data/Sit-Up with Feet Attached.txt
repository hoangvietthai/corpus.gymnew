Sit-Up with Feet Attached
Lie down on your back with your feet attached to the wing attachment and place your hands across your chest.
Roll your upper body up until your lower back no longer touches the glideboard and lower yourself back down after a short pause.
To avoid pulling your neck with your hands, look straight up instead of looking at your knees.
