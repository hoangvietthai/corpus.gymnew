Straight Bar Bench Mid Rows
Place a loaded barbell on the end of a bench. Standing on the bench behind the bar, take a medium, pronated grip. Stand with your hips back and chest up, maintaining a neutral spine. This will be your starting position.
Row the bar to your torso by retracting the shoulder blades and flexing the elbows. Use a controlled movement with no jerking.
After a brief pause, slowly return the bar to the starting position, ensuring to go all the way down.
