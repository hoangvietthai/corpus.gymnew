Partner Lying Leg Raise With Throw Down
 Lie supine on the floor with your feet together; your partner should position one foot on either side of your head and stand upright with his knees slightly bent. Grasp your partner's ankles to stabilize your torso. This will be your starting position.
 With a slight bend in your knees, do a reverse-crunch movement, raising your feet toward your partner while lifting your hips off the floor.
 Your partner should grab your ankles and push your feet back toward the start position. Donâ€™t allow your feet to contact the floor and smoothly reverse the direction, repeating for reps.
