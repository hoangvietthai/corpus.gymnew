Shoulder Extension
Sit on the top end of the glideboard and hold the handles above your knees, arms extended and palms facing down.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles straight back until your arms are perpendicular to the floor and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms fully extended throughout (or keep the small bend in your elbows constant).
