Straight-Legged Hip Raise
 Begin by lying on your back on the ground. Your legs should be straight and your arms at your side. This will be your starting position.
 To perform the movement, rotate and elevate your pelvis to raise your glutes from the floor.
 After a brief pause, return to the starting position.
