Medicine Ball Rotational Throw
  Stand with your side several feet away from a wall. Hold a medicine ball with both hands in an athletic stance. This will be your starting position. 
 Begin by rotating your shoulders away from the wall winding up in preparation for the throw. Immediately reverse direction, turning your shoulders and releasing the ball against the wall as fast as you can. 
 Receive the ball on the bounce and repeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions.
