Partner Target Sit-Up
  Lie face-up on the floor, knees bent and feet flat on the floor about hip-width apart. Cross your fingertips and raise your hands above your head while your partner carefully holds your feet down by stepping on your toes.
 Your partner should extend one hand out in front of them and above your knees. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by contracting your abs to lift your shoulder blades off the floor, reaching to touch your partnerâ€™s hand. Use the strength of your abs to drive higher, not simply reaching with your arms.
 Donâ€™t allow your shoulder blades to come completely down between reps to keep tension on the muscle. Your partner can move the target point higher or lower, and to one side or the other, to increase the challenge.
