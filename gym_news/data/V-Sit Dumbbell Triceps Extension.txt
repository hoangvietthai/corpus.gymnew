V-Sit Dumbbell Triceps Extension
 Start in a seated position on the ground, with a dumbbell placed next to you. Grab the dumbbell with both hands and bring it back behind your head. Your elbows should be bent to a 90-degree position, keeping your arms in close to your head and your elbows pointed forward. 
 Next, lift your heels off the ground so that your body makes a â€œVâ€ shape.  This will be your starting position.
 Keeping your core tight and abs contracted, bring the dumbbell up by extending the arms. Make sure not to lock out your elbows. Return the weight to the starting position and repeat for the recommended number of repetitions.
