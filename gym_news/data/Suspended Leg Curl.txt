Suspended Leg Curl
  Lie on your back in front of suspension straps adjusted to 12 to 18 inches off the ground. Place your feet in the straps, and then push down to raise your hips from the floor. Extend the knees, remembering to keep the body straight. This will be your starting position. 
 To perform the movement, flex the knees, drawing your feet towards your glutes. Pause at the peak of the contraction, and then slowly return to the starting position.
