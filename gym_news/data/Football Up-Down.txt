Football Up-Down
 Start with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms bent at your sides. 
 Begin to quickly move your feet, as if you were running in place, while keeping your hands in front of you. Maintain this intensity for 5 seconds.
 Next, drop down to the floor in a push up position, letting your abdomen come in contact with the floor. Quickly push up with your arms and bring your feet towards your body to get back up to the starting position. 
 Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions or time.
