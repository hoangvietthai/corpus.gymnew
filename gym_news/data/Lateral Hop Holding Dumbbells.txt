Lateral Hop Holding Dumbbells
 Begin this exercise by standing with your feet hip-width apart and holding light weight dumbbells down by your side.  This will be your starting position. 
 While holding on to the dumbbells, hop back and forth over an imaginary line for the desired number of repetitions.
 When you are done, lower the weight and place the dumbbells back on the floor.
