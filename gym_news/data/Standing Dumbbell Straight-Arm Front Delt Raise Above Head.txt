Standing Dumbbell Straight-Arm Front Delt Raise Above Head
 Hold the dumbbells in front of your thighs, palms facing your thighs.
  Keep your arms straight with a slight bend at the elbows but keep them locked. This will be your starting position.
  Raise the dumbbells in a semicircular motion to arm's length overhead as you exhale.
  Slowly return to the starting position using the same path as you inhale.
  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
