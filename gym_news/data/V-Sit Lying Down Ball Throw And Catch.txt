V-Sit Lying Down Ball Throw And Catch
 Lie supine on the floor holding a medicine ball between your hands just off your chest with your head and feet just off the floor, legs fully extended. This will be your starting position.
 Keeping your abdominals isometrically contracted to prevent your feet from touching the floor, throw the ball a few feet directly upward and catch it on the way down. Immediately repeat again for reps or time.
