Side Lunge Touching Heel
 Assume an athletic standing position, with the knees and hips slightly bent, feet hip-width apart, and the head and chest up. This will be your starting position.
 Staying low, take a slow, lateral step to the right. Keep your toes pointed forward and stay low. Extend the left knee, driving your weight to the right, flexing the knee and hip into a side lunge.
 As you lower yourself, reach across with your left hand to touch your right heel or ankle. Maintain good posture through the entire spine, keeping your head and chest up.
 Pause at the bottom of the motion, and then extend through the working leg to return to a standing position, transitioning into a lunge to the opposite side.
