Partner Facing Side Plank With Band Row
  Get into a side plank position by balancing your weight on one elbow and lifting your hips off of the floor. Keep your body straight and feet stacked. Your body should face your partner, about 7 feet away.
 Grasp one end of an elastic band with your top-side hand, arm extended. Your bodies should mirror each other. This will be your starting position.
 Simultaneously pull your elbow back as far as possible in a rowing motion to stretch the band, then release and again extending your arm forward.
 Do all reps for one side before switching sides.
