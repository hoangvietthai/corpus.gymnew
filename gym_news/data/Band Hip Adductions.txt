Band Hip Adductions
Anchor a band around a solid post or other object.
 Stand with your left side to the post, and put your right foot through the band, getting it around the ankle.
 Stand up straight and hold onto the post if needed. This will be your starting position. 
Keeping the knee straight, raise your right legs out to the side as far as you can.
 Return to the starting position and repeat for the desired rep count.
 Switch sides.
