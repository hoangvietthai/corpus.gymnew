Hand Release Push-Up
 Start on the floor with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Keep your legs fully extended and feet together. Your abdominals and lower body should be tight.  Keep your elbows at a 45 degree angle, rather than flaring them out wide.  This will be your starting position. 
 Allow your body to momentarily relax as you release your hands and feet briefly from contact with the ground.
 Immediately return your hands and feet to the ground and forcefully push up. This is one repetition. 
 Return to the starting position and repeat for the recommended number of repetitions.
