Burppe Box Jump
 Place a box or platform approximately an armâ€™s length away. Stand facing the box with your legs shoulder-width apart. This will be your starting position.
 Place your hands on the floor and quickly kick your legs back so you end up with your stomach and thighs on the floor and elbows bent. 
 From this position, press up like you're doing a push-up, and push your hips up. Jump your feet under your hips and begin to stand as you prepare to jump up.
 As you jump, jump forward so that you land on the box in front of you. This is one repetition.
 Quickly but gently step down from the box and repeat for recommended number of repetitions.
