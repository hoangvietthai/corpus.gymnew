Incline Dumbbell Press Reverse-Grip
  Lay on an incline bench holding a dumbbell in each hand. Begin with your arms extended above your torso with a supinated grip. 
 Your back should be arched, feet driving through the ground, and lats tight. This will be your starting position. 
 Lower the weights to your chest by flexing the elbows. 
 After a brief pause, return the weights to the starting position by extending the elbows
