Back Fly with Leg Curl
Sit on the top edge of the bench, attach your feet to the wing attachment and hold the handles with your hands, arms fully extended in front of you.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling on the handles towards the sides of your body while curling your knees and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your back straight throughout.
