Sprawl Frog Kick
 Begin in a standing position. Look directly forward, keeping your chest up, with your feet hip-distance apart. This will be your starting position.
 Bend at the knees and hips and place your hands on the floor while kicking your feet out behind you slightly wider than hip-distance apart. Bring your knees in towards your elbows quickly, without letting your toes touch the ground, then extend them back out behind you.
 Next, jump your legs back in, bringing them just outside your hands to a wide squat position. From here, jump all the way up, reaching your hands above your head. 
 Land with your knees slightly bent, and then go immediately into the next rep. Continue for the desired number of repetitions.
