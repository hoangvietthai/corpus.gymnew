Bodyweight Reverse Lunge
  Begin in a standing position. Your hands should be on your hips or hanging at your sides. Look directly forward, keeping your chest up, with your feet shoulder-width apart. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by taking a step to the rear, allowing your hips and knees to flex to lower your body. Contacting the back leg through only the ball of the foot, descend until your knee nearly touches the ground. Use a slow and controlled motion, paying special attention to proper mechanics and posture. The knee should stay in line with the foot, and the thoracic spine should remain neutral.
 After a brief pause, return to the starting position by driving through the heel of the front leg to extend the knees and hips.
 This movement can be done completely on one side before switching, or can be performed in an alternating fashion.
