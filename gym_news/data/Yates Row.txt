Yates Row
  Hold a barbell with a pronated grip a bit more than shoulder-width apart. Keep your feet hip-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Bend forward at the waist slightly and keep your back straight and your chest up. This will be your starting position. 
 Pull the barbell to your torso by flexing the elbows and retracting the shoulder blades. Avoid jerking the weight backward by extending your back or hips. 
 Reverse the motion to return the weight to the start position.
