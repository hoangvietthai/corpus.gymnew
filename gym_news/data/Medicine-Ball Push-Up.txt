Medicine-Ball Push-Up
  Start in the push-up position on the floor, keeping your hips down and back flat. 
 Place one hand on a medicine ball, while your other hand remains on the floor. Keep your feet spread fairly wide to help with stability. This will be your starting position.
 Keeping your body straight, bend your elbows and descend towards the ground, allowing your chest to approach the floor but stop before touching.
 Push back up to full arm extension and repeat for reps.
 Do the next set with the ball on the other side.
