Partner 3-Touch Motion Russian Twist
  Balance your body weight on your hips with your legs semi-extended and off the floor. Lean back so your torso is at a 45-degree angle to the floor, making sure to keep your back straight and not rounded.  You should be about 6 feet in front of your partner.
 Hold a weighted medicine ball in your hands just above your chest. This will be your starting position.
 Rotate your torso all the way to the right, back to the left, and to the right again by contracting your obliques, not simply turning only at the shoulders.
 With the ball back in front of you, pass across to your partner, who does the same three-touch motion before passing it back.
