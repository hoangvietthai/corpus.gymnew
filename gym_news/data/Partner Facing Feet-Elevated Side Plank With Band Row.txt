Partner Facing Feet-Elevated Side Plank With Band Row
  Get into a side plank position by balancing your weight on one elbow and stacking your feet about 6 inches off the floor. Keeping your body straight, lift your hips off the floor. Your body should face your partner, about 7 feet away.
 Grasp one end of an elastic band with your top-side hand, arm extended. This will be your starting position.
 Without twisting your bodies, simultaneously pull your elbows back as far as possible in a rowing motion to stretch the band, then release and again extending your arms forward.
 Do all reps for one side before switching sides.
