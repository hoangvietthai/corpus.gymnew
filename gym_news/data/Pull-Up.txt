Pull-Up
Lie prone on the glideboard and hold the wing attachment with your hands, plams facing down.
Slide the glideboard up by curling your elbows until your head is above it and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Breathe out while raising yourself and breathe in while lowering yourself back.
