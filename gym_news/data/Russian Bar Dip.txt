Russian Bar Dip
 Hop onto the parallel bars with your arms extended to support yourself, hands facing in. Keep your body vertical. This will be your starting position. 
 Lower yourself under control till thereâ€™s about a 90-degree bend in your shoulders, your forearms still perpendicular to the bars. Immediately shift your torso backward by repositioning your forearms so theyâ€™re now fully atop the parallel bars, body still straight. 
 Shift back the other way by moving your forearms to a perpendicular position once again. Contract your pecs and triceps to press back up to full arm extension, repeating for reps.
