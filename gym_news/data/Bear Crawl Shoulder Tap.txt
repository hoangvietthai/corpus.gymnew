Bear Crawl Shoulder Tap
 Bend down so that your hands are on the ground and your feet hip-distance a part. Your shoulders should be stacked over your wrists, your knees bent to 90 degrees, your back flat, and abs engaged. This will be your starting position. 
 Quickly bring one hand up to tap the opposite-side shoulder, placing that hand back on the floor before repeating to the opposite side. Concurrently your body will slightly shift from one side to the other to better maintain balance. Try to avoid your hips rocking from side to side. 
 Continue for the recommended number of repetitions.
