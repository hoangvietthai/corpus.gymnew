Upright Row with Hyperextension
Sit on the glideboard and hold the handles down above your ankles, arms and legs extended, palms facing down.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles up towards your shoulders while raising your back and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Breathe out while raising yourself and breathe in while lowering yourself back.
