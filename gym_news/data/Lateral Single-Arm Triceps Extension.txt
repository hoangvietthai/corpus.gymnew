Lateral Single-Arm Triceps Extension
Sit sideways on the glideboard and hold one handle with the hand furthest to it in front of your chest, elbow bent and palm facing your body.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handle back, straightening your arm and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your upper arm and upper body in the same position throughout.
