Skin The Cat To Push-Up
 Start in a dead hang position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. 
 Without using momentum, bring your toes up toward your head and allow your feet to continue through your arms. 
 Stay in a pike position and bring your toes toward the ground. Finish with your arms in full extension. 
 To initiate the rewind, tuck your head in and bring your thighs toward your chest. Finish in the hanging positioning, and then lower yourself down to the ground to complete one push-up. 
 This is one repetition. Complete for the desired number of repetitions.
