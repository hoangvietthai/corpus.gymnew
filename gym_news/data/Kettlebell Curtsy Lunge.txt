Kettlebell Curtsy Lunge
  Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell at waist height in front of you with both hands. You should be looking straight forward, with your chest up and shoulders back. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by shifting your weight to your right foot, lifting your left from the ground. While keeping your torso facing forward, place your left leg behind your right, taking a wide, lateral step behind the front leg.
 Descend into a lunge by bending your knees, lowering your body straight down. Continue until your front knee is at approximately 90 degrees, and then drive through the heel and extend the knee and hip.
 As you come back up, return the back leg to the starting position. Alternate the movement; switch back and forth between both sides for the desired number of repetitions.
