Burpee To Medicine Ball Press
 Start with a medicine ball a couple feet in front of you. With your feet about hip-width apart, squat down and place your hands on the medicine ball while simultaneously jumping your feet out into a plank position. Quickly jump your feet out into a wide squat stance, pick up the ball, and press it forward, away from your chest. 
 Reverse the motion by bringing the ball back into your chest, squatting down, and jumping back into a plank position. This is one rep. Repeat for the recommended number of reps. 
 For the duration of this exercise the medicine ball should never leave your hands.
