Kettlebell Sumo Squat
 Use 1 or 2 hands to pick up the kettlebell, pulling it up to your chest. Hold the kettlebell at chest level with both hands, making sure to keep your arms close to your body and elbows tucked in. Your feet should be slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outward. Keep your back straight and abdominals tight. This will be your starting position.
 Pushing your hips back, slowly bend the knees and lower your legs until your thighs are just below parallel to the floor. Make sure to inhale during this portion of the exercise.
 Press through the heel of the foot and push your hips through to return to the starting position. Breathe out during this phase of the exercise.
 Repeat for recommended number of repetitions before bending your knees to lower the kettle bell back to the ground.
