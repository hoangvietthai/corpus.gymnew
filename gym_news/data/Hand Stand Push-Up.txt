Hand Stand Push-Up
 Begin by facing a wall, standing 3 to 4 feet away from it.  Bending at the waist, lower your arms down to the ground and place them 4 to 6 inches from the wall, while simultaneously kicking your legs up towards the wallâ€”this is to be done in a quick, continuous motion. 
 Keep your glutes and abdominals tight, and your arms and legs fully extended. This will be your starting position. Begin to lower yourself to the ground, maintaining fully extended legs and feet together. Keep your elbows at roughly a 45 degree angleâ€”not flared completely out nor in a straight line with your upper arms. 
 Lower yourself until the top of your head grazes the ground. Once the bottom position is achieved, push through the hands, keeping your legs straight, and glutes and core tight, and return to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended number of repetitions.
