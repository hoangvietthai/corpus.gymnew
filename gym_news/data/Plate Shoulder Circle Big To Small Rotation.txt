Plate Shoulder Circle Big To Small Rotation
 Stand erect holding two 5-lb. plates directly out to your sides, arms fully extended. Position your thumbs on the outer edge of the plates and several fingers through the inside hole for a more secure grip. The plates should be horizontal to the floor. This will be your starting position. 
 Using a circular but deliberate motion do multiple arm circles, first starting with a small rotation and progressing to larger ones. Reverse course so you're again doing progressively smaller circles, then switch so youâ€™re doing it in the opposite direction. Again repeat from a smaller to larger circular motion.
