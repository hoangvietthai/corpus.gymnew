Half-kneeling Dumbbell Shoulder Press
  Select an appropriate load and adopt a half-kneeling position on the floor. Your right knee should be down, and your left knee up; take the weight with your right hand. Clean the dumbbell to your shoulder, using both hands if necessary. You should start with a neutral grip, with the palm in. Keep your head up, shoulders back, and your spine neutral. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by extending the arm, flexing and abducting the shoulder to rotate the arm as you press above your head. Pause at the top of the motion before reversing the movement to return to the starting position.
 Complete the desired number of repetitions before switching to the opposite side.
