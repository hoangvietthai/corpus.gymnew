Lateral Pulldown with Squat
Lie on your back on the glideboard, feet on the squat stand with your knees bent and hold the handles with your hands above your head, elbows slightly bent.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling on the handles towards the sides of your body while extending your legs and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep the small bend in your elbows constant throughout.
