Hip Abduction
Sit on the top end of the glideboard, legs straight and feet resting against and inside the cables and hold the handles with your hands, palms facing each other.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling your legs away from each other and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your legs and back straight throughout.
