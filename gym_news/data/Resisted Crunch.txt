Resisted Crunch
Lie down on your back with your knees bent and your feet on the glideboard and hold the handles with your hands, arms extended out and parallel to your thighs.
Roll your shoulder blades up from the glideboard by pushing on the handles while keeping your arms extended and lower yourself back down after a short pause.
To avoid pulling your neck with your hands, look straight up instead of looking at your knees.
