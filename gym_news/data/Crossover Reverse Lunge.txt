Crossover Reverse Lunge
Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position.
 Perform a rear lunge by stepping back with one foot and flexing the hips and front knee. As you do so, rotate your torso across the front leg.
 After a brief pause, return to the starting position and repeat on the other side, continuing in an alternating fashion.
