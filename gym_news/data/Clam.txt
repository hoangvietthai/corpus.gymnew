 Begin by lying on your side on the ground. Support your head on your left arm. Flex the hips to 45 degrees and the knees to approximately 90 degrees, with your right leg directly on top of your left. This will be your starting position. 
 Initiate the exercise by abducting your right leg, pushing your knee away from the midline of your body. Maintain contact between your feet throughout the movement. 
 Pause at the top of the motion, and then return to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. Do both sides.
