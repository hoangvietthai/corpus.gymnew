Suspended Chest Fly
 Adjust the straps to an appropriate height. The lower the position the more difficult the movement will be.
 Lean into the handles with your arms out in front of you, bracing your feet against a stable object if necessary. Your body should be straight, spine neutral, and your arms extended and palms facing each other. This will be your starting position. 
 Perform the exercise by allowing your arms to move laterally, away from the midline of the body, lowering your torso between the handles. The elbows may bend slightly during the movement. Pause when the upper arm is perpendicular to the torso, and then return to the starting position.
