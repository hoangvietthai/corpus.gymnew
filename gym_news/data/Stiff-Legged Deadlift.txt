Stiff-Legged Deadlift
 Grasp a bar on the floor using an overhand grip. Stand with your torso straight and a shoulder-width stance. The knees should be slightly bent. This is your starting position. 
 Keeping the knees stationary, lower the barbell to over the top of your feet by bending at the waist while keeping your back arched. 
 Continue to the bottom of your hip flexibility without ever compensating through your lumbar in an effort to extend the range of motion. Pause at the bottom and return to the starting position. 
 Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
