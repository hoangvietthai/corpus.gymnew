Suspended Push-Up
  Anchor your suspension straps securely to the top of a rack or other object. Grab the handles with an overhand grip and set yourself up in a push-up position so that your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles. Your arms should be fully extended and your core tight to help maintain proper position. 
 Maintaining a straight, ridged torso, descend slowly by allowing the elbows to flex. 
 Continue until your elbows break 90 degrees, pausing before you extend to return to the starting position.
