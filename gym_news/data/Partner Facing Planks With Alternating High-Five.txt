Partner Facing Planks With Alternating High-Five
  Get into a plank position with your weight evenly distributed on your elbows and toes, keeping your back straight and your hips in line with your back.
 Your partner should mirror your body position about 2 feet in front of and facing you. This will be your starting position.
 Maintaining your body weight on three limbs, raise one hand in front of your body and reach across to tap your partnerâ€™s hand.
 Lower and re-establish the plank position and complete on the opposite side.
