Single Arm Overhead Kettlebell Squat
 From a standing position, press a single kettlebell overhead by extending the elbow and flexing the shoulder. You should be looking directly forward, with your chest up, knees and hips slightly bent, and your back straight. This will be your starting position. 
 Descend into a squat by flexing your hips and knees. As you squat, keep your weight on your heels and push your knees out. Maintain proper curvature of your entire spine, from the lower back all the way up through your cervical spine. Descend as far as your flexibility allows or until you have reached a full squat position. Avoid excessive forward lean, rounding your lumbar or thoracic spine, and keep the kettlebell in place throughout the exercise.
 After a brief pause, return to the starting position by extending through the hips and knees. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
