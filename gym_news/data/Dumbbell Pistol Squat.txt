Dumbbell Pistol Squat
 From a standing position, hold an upright dumbbell in both hands close to your chest. Raise one foot an inch or two off the floor. You should be looking directly forward, with your chest up, knees and hips slightly bent, and your back straight. This will be your starting position.
 Descend into a squat by flexing your hips and knee. As you squat, extend the non-working leg forward to allow clearance for your movement. Descend slowly, paying close attention to balance and proper movement mechanics, going as far as your flexibility allows.
 Hold the bottom position briefly and then return to the start by extending through the hips and knee, driving through the heel of your working foot.
 Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides.
