Southpaw Sprawl
 Begin in a standing position with your chest up and your feet hip-width apart. This will be your starting position. 
 Bend at the knees and hips, placing one hand on the ground and jumping your feet out slightly wider than hip-distance apart. 
 Keeping your one hand on the ground, quickly cross your feet, then jump them back out before jumping into a wide squat. 
 Jump back up to the starting position and repeat with the other arm. Make sure to alternate arms each rep.
