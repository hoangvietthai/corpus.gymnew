Single Leg Pullover with Squat
Lie on your back on the glideboard, one knee bent and its foot against the squat stand while the other leg is extended out and hold the handles with your hands, arms extended up in line with your body.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles down towards your thighs while at the same time extending your leg and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms straight throughout.
