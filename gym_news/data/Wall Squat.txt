Wall Squat
 Begin with your back against the wall and your feet 18-24 inches out in front of you. Have your feet in a shoulder-width stance, toes pointed slightly outward and knees slightly out. This will be your starting position.
 Descend slowly by â€˜slidingâ€™ down the wall. Keep your head up and maintain a flat back against the wall. 
 Continue down until the upper legs are at or just below parallel to the floor. Maintain this position for the recommended amount of time. Focus on breathing continuously throughout.
 Push through your heels to return upwards to the starting position.
 Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
