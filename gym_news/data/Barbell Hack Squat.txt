Barbell Hack Squat
Stand up straight while holding a barbell behind you at arms length and your feet at shoulder width. 
 A shoulder width grip is best with the palms of your hands facing back.  You can use wrist wraps for this exercise for a better grip.  This will be your starting position.
While keeping your head and eyes up and back straight, squat until your upper thighs are parallel to the floor.  Breathe in as you slowly go down. 
Pressing mainly with the heel of the foot and squeezing the thighs, go back up as you breathe out.
Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
