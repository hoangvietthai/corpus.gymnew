Fast Kick With Arm Circles
 Start with your feet hip-width apart and arms straight out by your side. Your arms should be parallel to the floor with palms facing down. This is your starting position.
 Start to make small, forward circles with each arm, at the same time. As you're doing this, kick your right foot forward, and then quickly alternate by bringing your right foot back down and your left foot forward. 
 Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
