Hip Adduction
Lie sideways on the glideboard with one foot attached to the leg pull attachment, its leg straight and prependicular to the floor.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling your leg down towards the other one and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your leg straight throughout.
