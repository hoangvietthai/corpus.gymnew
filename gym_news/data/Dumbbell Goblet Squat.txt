Dumbbell Goblet Squat
  From a standing position cradle the head of a dumbbell close to your chest with both hands. You should be looking straight forward, with your shoulders back, your spine straight, and your feet just outside of shoulder width. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement by descending into a squat, flexing the hips and knees to lower your body. Maintain the angle of your torso, paying close attention to the preservation of your spine. As you descend, push your knees outward and keep your weight on your heels.
 Descend until you either reach the full squat position with your hamstrings on your calves or until your back starts to round. At the bottom of the motion pause briefly.
 Return to the starting position by driving through your heels, extending the knees and hips to return to the starting position. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.
