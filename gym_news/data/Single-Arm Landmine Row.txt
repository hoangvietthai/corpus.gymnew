Single-Arm Landmine Row
  Securely position a bar in a landmine and load it to an appropriate weight. Stand perpendicular to the bar, bending at the hip and grasping the end of the bar with your inside hand. Support your body with your free arm by bracing it against your thigh. Keep your back straight and knees slightly bent. This will be your starting position. 
 Initiate the movement by retracting the scapula and flexing the elbow to raise the weight. Pull the weight to your side without jerking the weight pausing at the top of the pull. 
 Return to the starting position and repeated for the desired number of repetitions.
