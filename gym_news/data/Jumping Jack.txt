Jumping Jack
 Begin by standing with your feet together, knees slightly bent, and arms to your side. This will be your starting position. 
 Jump by extending the knees and ankles while raising your arms and shifting your legs outward. Land on the balls of your feet with legs apart and arms overhead. 
 Re-bend the knees and jump again while lowering your arms and returning your legs to the starting position. 
 Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
