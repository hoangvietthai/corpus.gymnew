Alien Squat
 Position your legs using a very wide stance with the toes slightly pointed out and knees slightly bent. Rest your hands on your hips. Keep your neck neutral and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position.
 Descend into a half squat by pushing your hips and butt back. Then push through your heels and jump straight up while simultaneously kicking each leg outward at a 45 degree angle. 
 Land back in the starting position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions or time.
