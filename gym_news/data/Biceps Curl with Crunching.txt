Biceps Curl with Crunching
Lie on your back on the glideboard, knees bent and hold the handles with your arms extended, palms facing up and raise your upper body from up the mat.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles towards your shoulders and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your upper body off the glideboard and your upper arms in the same position throughout.
