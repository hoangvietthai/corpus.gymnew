Neck Bridge Prone
  Begin in a prone position on the floor, on your hands and knees.
 Place your head next to your hands but a few inches nearer your legs, then extend your legs, driving your hips into the air.
 Transition into supporting your weight on your head by removing your hands from the ground. Perform this movement slowly, backing off if any serious discomfort is felt and avoiding it if you have any pre-existing neck injury.
 Hold the neck bridge for a period of time, and then carefully return your hands and knees to the floor.
