Shoulder Extension with Hyperextension
Kneel on the glideboard and crouch to hold the handles with your arms extended and palms facing down.
Slide the glideboard up by pulling the handles straight back until your arms are perpendicular to the floor while raising your upper body and allow yourself back down after a short pause.
Keep your arms fully extended throughout (or keep the small bend in your elbows constant).
