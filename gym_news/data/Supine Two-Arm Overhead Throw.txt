Supine Two-Arm Overhead Throw
Lay on the ground on your back with your knees bent.
 Hold the ball with both hands, extending the arms fully behind your head. This will be your starting position.
 Initiate the movement at the shoulder, throwing the ball directly forward of you as you sit up, attempting to go for maximum distance. 
The ball can be thrown to a partner or bounced off of a wall.
